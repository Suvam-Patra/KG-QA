# Knowledge Graphs
A knowledge graph is a structured representation of knowledge in the form of a directed graph. In a knowledge graph, entities are represented as nodes, and relationships between entities are represented as directed edges connecting the nodes. This graph-like structure allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and reasoning about complex relationships and information.

Knowledge graphs are used to model and organize vast amounts of heterogeneous data from various sources, enabling powerful data integration and knowledge discovery. They are employed in a wide range of applications, including the semantic web, natural language processing, recommendation systems, question-answering systems, and more.
A knowledge graph is a powerful tool that can provide many benefits. Some of the key benefits of using a knowledge graph include:

**Data integration:** Knowledge graphs can help link and harmonize data from diverse sources, fostering data sharing and collaboration among organizations, and allowing for a more comprehensive view of the information.

**Enhanced understanding:** Knowledge graphs provide a richer context and understanding of information by representing relationships between entities in a visual and intuitive way.

**Combining siloed data sources:** Knowledge graphs help to combine disparate silos of data, giving you an overview of all of your knowledge â€“ not only departmentally but also across departments and global organizations.

**Combining structured and unstructured data:** Knowledge graph technology means being able to connect different types of data in meaningful ways and supporting richer data services than most knowledge management systems.

**Informed decision making:** Using a knowledge graph means no more looking through piles of paper to find a particular document as knowledge graphs provide relevant facts and contextualized answers to your specific questions, rather than a broad search result with lots of irrelevant information.

# LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence that can generate human-like text and perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to a wide range of prompts. LLMs have the ability to understand and generate text in multiple languages, making them a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks such as question answering, text generation, and language translation. LLMs are used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and content-generation tools.
